This pesticide is toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates .
Drift and runoff may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in
water adjacent to treated areas .
DO NOT apply directly to water, or to areas where surface
water is present or to intertidal areas below the mean high
water mark . DO NOT apply where runoff is likely to occur .
DO NOT contaminate water when disposing of equipment
washwaters or rinsate . Observe caution when spraying in
the vicinity of aquatic areas such as lakes, reservoirs, riv-
ers, permanent streams, marshes or natural ponds and
estuaries .
This product may impact surface water quality due to run-
off of rainwater . This is especially true for poorly draining
soils and soils with shallow groundwater .
Surface Water Advisory
This product is classified as having high potential for
reaching aquatic sediment via runoff for several months or
more after application . Poorly draining soils and soils with
shallow water tables are more prone to produce runoff that
contains this product . A level, well-maintained vegetative
buffer strip between areas to which this product is applied
and surface water features such as ponds, streams, and
springs will reduce the potential loading of this active ingre-
dient or its degradates from runoff water and sediment .
Runoff of this product will be reduced by avoiding applica-
tions when rainfall is forecast to occur within 48 hours .
Sound erosion control practices will reduce this product’s
potential to reach aquatic sediment via runoff .
Groundwater Advisory
This chemical has properties and characteristics associa-
ted with chemicals detected in groundwater . This chemical
may leach into groundwater if used in areas where soils
are permeable, particularly where the water table is
shallow .
Directions For Use
It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a man-
ner inconsistent with its labeling . DO NOT apply this
product in a way that will contact workers or other per-
sons, either directly or through drift . Only protected
handlers may be in the area during application . For any
requirements specific to your state or tribe, consult the
agency responsible for pesticide regulation .
USER SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS
Users should:<br>• Wash hands before eating, drinking, chewing gum,<br>using tobacco, or using the toilet .<br>• Remove clothing/PPE immediately if pesticide gets<br>inside . Then wash thoroughly and put on clean<br>clothing .<br>• Remove PPE immediately after handling this product .<br>As soon as possible, wash thoroughly and change into<br>clean clothing .
