Use Notes
• Use higher rates within the recommended rate range for
plant sizes listed when vegetation cover is dense or
when weeds are growing under stressed conditions
such as drought or when average temperatures are
below 50º F.
• The addition of 8.5 to 17 pounds of ammonium sulfate
(spray grade) per 100 gallons of water (1 to 2% by
weight) or 2 to 4 pounds of ammonium sulfate per acre
may improve the level of weed control.
Where to Apply
Trimming and Edging
Finale may be used for trimming and edging landscape
areas such as: around individual trees and shrubs, land-
scape beds, foundations, fences, driveways, paths, and
parking areas; also on golf courses along cart paths,
around sign and light posts, and around sand traps. For
control of weeds emerging from seed, the use of Finale in
a tank mix with preemergence herbicides is recommend-
ed. If spraying in areas adjacent to desirable plants, use a
shield made of cardboard, plywood, or sheet metal while
spraying to help prevent spray from contacting foliage of
desirable plants. Refer to the How to Apply section of this
labeling for appropriate application rates to control specific
weeds.

product controls annual and perennial weeds listed on this

banks, dry ditches, schools, parking lots, tank farms,
