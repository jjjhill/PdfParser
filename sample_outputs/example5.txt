Tank Mixing Other Products and Additives
It is the pesticide user’s responsibility to ensure that all
products in the mixtures are registered for the intended
use. Read and follow the applicable restrictions and pre-
cautions and directions for use on all product labels
involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restric-
tive directions for use and precautionary statements of
each product in the tank mixture.
Finale® XL F-VM herbicide may be tank mixed or
applied sequentially with other herbicide products regis-
tered for use in any use site found in this label. Refer to the
tank mix product labels to confirm that the respective tank
mix products are registered for the intended use. Read
and follow the specific tank mixing instructions on this
label and respective product labels.
Finale XL F-VM may be tank mixed with one or more pre-
emergence herbicide(s) for residual control of emerging
underground reproductive plant parts or weed seeds, as
well as vegetative growth from previously treated plants.
Additives
Addition of nonionic antifoaming agent may reduce foam-
ing, especially when using soft water.
Spray drift control additives may be used; read and follow
all directions and precautions as specified on the drift con-
trol additive label.
Ammonium sulfate (AMS), methylated seed oil (MSO), or non-
ionic surfactant (NIS) may be added for foliar applications.
For optimum burndown activity with Finale XL F-VM and
to achieve consistent weed control in postemergence use
patterns, an adjuvant system may be used that includes
any of the following:
Additive/Adjuvant | Rate
AMS (spray grade) | 2 to 4 lbs/A
plus one of the following | plus one of the following
MSO | 1% volume/volume (v/v)
or | or
NIS | 0.25% v/v
Compatibility Test for Tank Mixing Other
Products and Additives
Before tank mixing components, always perform a com-
patibility jar test.
1. In a clear glass jar, add components in the order listed.
2. Add the appropriate amount of herbicide in the following
order: (a) dry flowable, (b) wettable powder, (c) aqueous
suspensions, (d) flowables, (e) liquids, and (f) solutions
and emulsifiable or liquid concentrates. Shake or gently
stir jar after each addition to thoroughly mix.
3. After all components have been added, cap jar, tighten
lid, and invert ten cycles to mix.
4. Let solution in jar stand for 15 minutes.
5. Evaluate the solution for uniformity and stability. Look
for separation, large flakes, precipitates, gels, heavy oily
film on the jar, or other signs of incompatibility. If the
tank mix partners are not compatible, DO NOT use the
mixture in any spray solution that could clog spray
nozzles.
Mixing Order
Make sure each component is thoroughly mixed and sus-
pended before adding tank mix partners. Maintain
constant agitation during mixing and application until
spraying is completed.
1. Start with calibrated and clean equipment.
2. Fill the spray tank half full with water.
3. Start agitation.
4. If mixing with a flowable/wettable powder tank mix part-
ner prepare a slurry of the appropriate amount of the
product in a small amount of water. Add the slurry to the
spray tank.
5. Add ammonium sulfate (AMS) to the spray tank if
needed.
6. If mixing with a liquid tank mix partner, add the liquid
mix partner next.
7. Complete filling the spray tank with water before add-
ing Finale XL F-VM, because foaming may occur.
8. Add Finale XL F-VM when tank is full and continue
agitation.
9. If foaming occurs, use a silicone-based antifoaming
agent.
