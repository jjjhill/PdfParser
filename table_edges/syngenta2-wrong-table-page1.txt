• All leaks resulting in the deposition of termiticide in locations
other than those prescribed on this label must be cleaned up
prior to leaving the application site. Do not allow people or
pets to contact contaminated areas or to reoccupy the contami-
nated area until the clean-up is completed.
• Use anti-backflow equipment or procedures to prevent siphon-
age of pesticide back into water supplies.
Care should be taken that the treatment solution is not intro-
duced into the gravel and/or pipe drainage system which may
be located on the exterior of the foundation in close proximity
to the footing of the structure.
SUBTERRANEAN TERMITE CONTROL (including
Eastern, Western, and Formosan Termites)
USE DIRECTIONS
Whenever possible, make termite control applications near the
structure foundation using soil injections.
Apply a 0.25%-0.50% emulsion to establish subsurface termite
control barriers as specified on product labeling.
Consult State and local specifications for recommended distance of
treatment areas from wells or, if such regulations do not exist, refer
to Federal Housing Administration Specifications for guidance.

APPLICATION VOLUMES
To provide maximum control and protection against termite
infestation, apply the specified volume of the finished water and
active ingredient emulsion as set forth in the use directions sec-
tion of this label. If soil will not accept the labeled application
volume, the volume may be reduced provided there is a corre-
sponding increase in concentration so that the amount of active
ingredient applied to the soil remains the same. See Volume
Adjustment Chart for specific information.
Note: Large reductions of application volume reduce the ability
to obtain a continuous barrier. Variance is allowed when volume
and concentration are consistent with label directed rates and a
continuous barrier can still be achieved.
Note: When volume is reduced, the hole spacing for sub-slab
injection and soil rodding may require similar adjustments to
account for lower volume dispersal of the termiticide in the soil.
Do not use volume adjustments at 1% for sub-slab injection.

PRECONSTRUCTION SUBTERRANEAN
TERMITE TREATMENT
Effective preconstruction subterranean termite control requires
the establishment of an unbroken vertical and/or horizontal
chemical barrier between wood in the structure and the termite
colonies in the soil.
USE RESTRICTIONS
• Prior to each application, applicators must notify the general
contractor, construction superintendent, or similar responsible
party of the intended termiticide application and intended
sites of application and instruct the responsible person to
notify construction workers and other individuals to leave the
area to be treated during application and until the termiticide
is absorbed into the soil.
• The treatment site must be covered prior to a rain event in
order to prevent run-off of the pesticide into non-target areas.
• The applicator must either cover the soil her/himself or provide
written notification of the requirement to the contractor on site
and to the person commissioning the application (if different
than the contractor). If notice is provided to the contractor or
the person commissioning the application, then they are respon-
sible under FIFRA to ensure that: 1) if the concrete slab cannot
be poured over the treated soil within 24 hours of application,
the treated soil is covered with a waterproof covering (such
as polyethylene sheeting); and, 2) the treated soil is covered if
precipitation is predicted to occur before the concrete slab is
scheduled to be poured.
• Do not treat soil that is water-saturated or frozen.
• Do not treat when raining.
• Do not allow treatment to run off from the target area.
• Do not apply within 10 feet of storm drains. Do not apply
within 25 feet of aquatic habitats (such as, but not limited to,
lake, reservoirs, rivers, permanent streams, marshes or natural
ponds, estuaries, and commercial fish farm ponds).
• Do not make on-grade applications when sustained wind
speeds are above 10 mph (at application site) at nozzle-end
height.
To meet Federal Housing Administration termite-proofing
requirements, follow the latest edition of the Housing and Urban
Development (H.U.D.) Minimum Property Standards.
